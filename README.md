# H1 Sustainability app prototype
This was a project that I created for my engineering 100 class.
The purpose of this project was to design a prototype of an app that would make a home more sustainable.
Me and my team decided on controlling energy consumption in the home and to help the user do that we would give them live time data
although that feature is not built into this prototype.
This prototype was code entirely by me and based off of the paper models that me and my team made
